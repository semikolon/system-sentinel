# Docker Infrastructure Migration Plan

> **MOVED**: This document has been relocated to the dotfiles repository where it belongs with other Graphiti/Claude Code operational documentation.

**Canonical location**: `~/dotfiles/.claude/plans/docker_orbstack_migration_plan.md`

**Why moved**: The migration primarily affects Graphiti (which runs in Docker) and the Claude Code workflow. Keeping it with the Graphiti stdio migration plan maintains single source of truth.

**Related incident reports** (remain here in system-sentinel):
- `docs/incident_reports/docker_shutdown_cc_crash_2026_01_16.md`
- `docs/incident_reports/disk_space_analysis_2026_01_15.md`
